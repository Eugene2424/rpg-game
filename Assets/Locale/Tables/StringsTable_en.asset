    m_Localized: "It seemed as though nothing threatened this world. People lived,
      unaware of what awaited them in the future.  \r\nOne calm day, enormous gates
      unexpectedly appeared in the middle of the forest. They were colossal,  \r\ntheir
      height could rival mountains. It felt like darkness was about to seep through
      them.  \r\nThe gates opened, and from them emerged monsters unlike anything
      the world had ever seen.  \r\nHumanity was gripped by fear, it seemed as though
      there was no hope for the future.  \r\nDespite this, people managed to survive.
      Later, they discovered an unseen power within themselves \u2014  \r\nthe ability
      to use magic. Thanks to this, humanity restored order, and life became easier. 
      \r\nHowever, they couldn\u2019t defeat all the monsters, so people resigned
      themselves and continued to live,  \r\nwhile simultaneously defending against
      the creatures."

      what I'll do."
